# Hey, I'm Ben 👋

Senior Cloud Engineer with experience operating and scaling Kubernetes-based infrastructure across enterprise and startup environments.

I design, build, and run production cloud systems under real-world constraints, including regulated environments, enterprise security requirements, and high availability expectations.

Former IBM Senior Cloud Engineer, where I led customer-facing Kubernetes and cloud platform engagements across AWS, GCP, and IBM Cloud.  
Currently building educational and reference platforms for Cloud, Platform, and Solutions Engineers, while running Sproutflow Studio, a hands-on technical consultancy.

I specialize in systems that need to be **understood, operated, and trusted**.

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- Designing Kubernetes and cloud platforms that hold up in constrained or regulated environments  
- Infrastructure-as-Code and GitOps patterns that scale beyond demos  
- Enabling engineers through clear architecture, documentation, and decision-making frameworks  
- Bridging product, engineering, and customers without sacrificing technical rigor

## 🚀 Flagship Work

### Platform & Infrastructure Engineering

- **[implementation-studio](https://github.com/WBHankins93/implementation-studio)**  
  A production-oriented deployment patterns platform based on real enterprise constraints: air-gapped networks, private clusters, restricted egress, and security controls.  
  Includes hands-on labs and Terraform modules for AWS and GCP, designed to mirror environments where failure is not theoretical.

- **[devops-studio](https://github.com/WBHankins93/devops-studio)**  
  A reference architecture library covering Kubernetes, Terraform, GitOps, CI/CD, and observability.  
  Built to reflect how platform teams actually work, not idealized tutorials.

### Solutions Engineering & Enablement

- **[solutions-playbook](https://github.com/WBHankins93/solutions-playbook)**  
  An operational framework for Solutions Engineers covering the full customer lifecycle.  
  Structured around “moments of need” to support real pre-sales, delivery, and post-sales workflows.

---

## 🏗 Selected Production Systems

- **[terraform-infra-platform](https://github.com/WBHankins93/terraform-infra-platform)**  
  Modular Terraform platform that reduced enterprise POC build times by ~40%.  
  Used across 20+ customer engagements.

- **[gcp-gke-gitops](https://github.com/WBHankins93/gcp-gke-gitops)**  
  Production GitOps reference architecture used in customer workshops and technical demos.

## 🌐 Client & Full-Stack Work

While infrastructure is my core focus, I also build and ship end-to-end systems when needed:

- **[Nealy Event Decor](https://www.nealyevents.com)** – E-commerce + booking platform (Next.js / TypeScript)  
- **[Big Butt Association](https://www.bigbuttassociation.com)** – Shopify-based e-commerce with membership features  
- **[Second Line Psychiatry](https://www.secondlinepsychiatry.com)** – Healthcare site with patient portal  
- **[Sproutflow Studio](https://www.sproutflow-studio.com)** – Technical consultancy and case studies  
- **[Personal Portfolio](https://benhankins.vercel.app)** – Engineering-focused portfolio
