# Hi, I'm Ben Hankins 👋
**Senior SRE / DevOps Engineer | Fullstack Developer | Automation Wizard 🪄**

**[personal-website](https://benhankins.vercel.app/)**

I design, build, and secure cloud platforms that scale, combining deep experience in **Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and observability** with a developer’s eye for automation and UX.  
My background blends **infrastructure reliability** with **fullstack product delivery**, giving me the unique ability to create systems that are not only resilient and secure, but also intuitive and delightful to use.
