# Hey, I'm Ben 👋

Full-stack engineer with production infrastructure depth and a track record of owning the complete product lifecycle. I build the product, deploy it, keep it running, and talk to customers about it. That combination is uncommon and intentional.

Background spans early web development at a SaaS startup, enterprise cloud architecture at IBM, production SRE at Prove AI, and end-to-end client delivery through Sproutflow Studio.

I specialize in environments where breadth matters as much as depth.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Build and ship production web applications using TypeScript, Next.js, and React
- Design and operate Kubernetes-based cloud infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and IBM Cloud
- Run the full customer engagement cycle: discovery, scoping, architecture, delivery, and handoff
- Bridge product, engineering, and customers without sacrificing technical rigor
