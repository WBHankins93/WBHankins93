# Hey, I'm Ben 👋

Senior Cloud Engineer with experience operating and scaling Kubernetes-based infrastructure across enterprise and startup environments.

I design, build, and run production cloud systems under real-world constraints, including regulated environments, enterprise security requirements, and high availability expectations.

Former IBM Senior Cloud Engineer, where I led customer-facing Kubernetes and cloud platform engagements across AWS, GCP, and IBM Cloud.  
Currently building educational and reference platforms for Cloud, Platform, and Solutions Engineers, while running Sproutflow Studio, a hands-on technical consultancy.

I specialize in systems that need to be **understood, operated, and trusted**.
